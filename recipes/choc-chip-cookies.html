<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These are the absolute best. Need I say more? Thank you to Brian Lagerstrom.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 sticks/1 cup (200g) nice butter</li>
    <li>½ cup (100g) granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup (200g) dark brown sugar</li>
    <li>2 large eggs + 1 extra yolk</li>
    <li>1¼ tsp (4g) vanilla extract</li>
    <li>8oz of 70% cacao nice baking chocolate (bars not chips)</li>
    <li>330g all purpose flour</li>
    <li>½tsp baking soda</li>
    <li>¼tsp baking powder</li>
    <li>1¼tsp (7g) salt</li>
    <li>+ flakey salt for topping</li>
</ul>
<h2>Method</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Into the bowl of a stand mixer, add room temperature butter and the sugars. Using the paddle attachment, cream for 6-7 minutes on high speed. At the end of the creaming, your mixture should look the way it does in the video.  Creaming times will vary slightly based on the temperature of your product.</li>
    <li>Then add in eggs + yolk and vanilla and cream on medium-low for 1 more minute, just to combine.</li>
    <li>Add flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt and mix on low for about 30 seconds.</li>
    <li>Roughly chop the chocolate. Transfer the chocolate into a colander or salad spinner and gently shake to remove some of the fine grains of chocolate so you're left with mostly the large chunks.</li>
    <li>Reserve 15-20 of the chocolate chunks and gently fold the rest into the mixture until well distributed.</li>
    <li>Using a 4oz scoop or 1/2 measuring cup, scoop cookies onto a small tray, dropping a couple of chocolate chunks into the bottom of the scooper before scooping. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours, but preferably longer.</li>
    <li>When you're ready to bake, preheat oven to 375F/190C. Place cookies on two flat, parchment-lined baking sheets. I do 4 cookies per sheet since these are XL cookies and need room to spread.</li>
    <li>Top each cookie with a sprinkle of flakey salt. Bake for around 18 minutes or until edges are golden brown, but still soft in the middle.</li>
